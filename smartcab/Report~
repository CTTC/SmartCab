QUESTION: Observe what you see with the agent's behavior as it takes random actions. Does the smartcab eventually make it to the destination? Are there any other interesting observations to note?

Answer: Give longer time, the smartcab (the red cab) can have higher probability ot reach the destination eventually. Sometimes, it hit the hard time limit before reaching the destination. If the deadline is set up, the probability of failure to reach the destination is higher than the case when there is no deadline. Since it proceeded in a random action at each intersection, it makes sense that it would take much longer time to reach the destination. Basically, the smartcab just randomly move across the whole streets, and it ran into the destination just by chance since no policy or strategy was learned till now. When there was no deadline, the smartcab reached the destination before hitting the hard time limit 58 times out of 100 trials (58%). When there was a deadline on each trial, the smartcab only succeeded 28 times out of 100 trials (28%).
